<h2>Register to vote</h2>
<p class="changetext">Voting is a fundamental part of every democracy. It allows us to choose the people in charge, and make sure we are represented fairly. While the legal voting age in the United States is 18 years old, you can still register to vote in most places at 17, but the exact age varies by state, so be sure to check your state laws. If you are old enough to register to vote in your state, click <a href="https://vote.gov/" target="_blank">here</a>. If you would like to learn more about the process of voting, requesting an absentee ballot, or see local polling locations, click <a href="https://www.vote.org/">here</a>. It will direct you to Vote.org, a nonprofit dedicated to providing access to voting information.<br>Some states will even let you vote in the primaries at 17 as long as you will be 18 by the time of the general election. To see if your state lets you vote in the primaries at 17, click <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primaries-voting-age.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<h2>Petitions</h2>
<p class="changetext">If you want a way to get involved in issues you care about but can't vote or attend a protest, petitions are a good way to start. By signing petitions, you will be able to show those in charge how many people care about a certain issue. Once the interest is apparent, they will likely act accordingly, and potentially pass new legislation based on the will of the people. Some good websites that host petitions are <a href="https://www.change.org" target="_blank">change.org</a> and <a href="https://www.thepetitionsite.com/" target="_blank">care2 petitions</a>, or visit the ACLU site to other ways to help causes you care about <a href="https://www.aclu.org/action" target="_blank">here</a> with the ACLU.</p>

<h2>Protests</h2>
<p class="changetext">If you would prefer that your voice is heard in real life, attending a protest sounds like the choice for you. Attending a protest is a great way to express your beliefs and be around like-minded people. Protests have helped women and people of color achieve our rights, as well as encourage the passing of new legislation. At a protest, it is very important to 1) stay safe and 2) remember your rights. You can not be legally punished for peacefully protesting, as long as you are not inciting aggression or saying anything that could cause violence. If you are attending a protest, walkout, or similar event at school, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has this helpful <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/student-speech-and-privacy/students-rights-speech-walkouts-and-other-protests" target="_blank">guide</a> that lays out your rights when protesting as a student.<br>For a live map of upcoming protests and events across the United States, click <a href="https://map.peoplepower.org/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Internship opportunities</h2>
<p class="changetext">To gain firsthand experience, you may consider doing an internship with someone in public office.
