<h1>Our Mission</h1>

<p class="changetext">  Welcome to Students Taking Action for Nationwide Democracy, or S.T.A.N.D. We are an informational website catered to students and created by students. Our mission is to educate students and teens on current political issues, events, and controversial topics. Under the issues tab, you can read about some of the biggest issues regarding United States legislation and society. We also provide access and information about internships with your local Congress members. Furthermore, you can also find out how to volunteer for your local Democratic or Republican committee! Enjoy fun games and quizzes ranging from a maze game to personality quizzes. We urge you to further involve yourself in supporting causes that affect and or interest you. In addition, we aim to provide a better overall understanding about debates, protests, and other political events taking place in the nation. Feel free to explore the website and leave comments regarding any concerns or thoughts!</p>
